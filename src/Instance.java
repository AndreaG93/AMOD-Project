/**
 * This class models an instance of the cutting-stock problem.
 * <p>
 * The cutting stock problem consists of a number of orders
 * <p>
 * of certain sizes. The question is how we can most efficiently
 * <p>
 * cut the orders out of larger stock such that we need the least
 * <p>
 * amount of large stock.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * For example, we have to produce metal bars. The orders indicate
 * <p>
 * how many bars of a certain length we must produce. The capacity
 * <p>
 * indicates how long a bar is that we can cut up into smallers bars
 * <p>
 * required for the order. The goal is to cut up as few large bars
 * <p>
 * as possible.
